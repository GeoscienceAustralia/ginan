# Ginan: Software toolkit and service

#### `Ginan v3.0.0`

## Overview

Ginan is a processing package being developed to process GNSS observations for geodetic applications.

We currently support the processing of:

* the United States' Global Positioning System (**GPS**);
* the European Union's Galileo system (**Galileo**);
* the Russian GLONASS system (**GLONASS**)\*;
* the Chinese Navigation Satellite System (**BeiDou**)\*;
* the Japanese QZSS develop system (**QZSS**)\*.

We are actively developing Ginan to have the following capabilities and features:

* Precise Orbit & Clock determination of GNSS satellites (GNSS POD);
* Precise Point Positioning (PPP) of GNSS stations in network and individual mode;
* Real-Time corrections for PPP users;
* Analyse full, single and multi-frequency, multi-GNSS data;
* Delivering atmospheric products such as ionosphere and troposphere models;
* Servicing a wide range of users and receiver types;
* Delivering outputs usable and accessible by non-experts;
* Providing both a real-time and off-line processing capability;
* Delivering both position and integrity information;
* Routinely produce IGS final, rapid, ultra-rapid and real-time (RT) products;
* Model Ocean Tide Loading (OTL) displacements.

The software consists of three main components:
* Network Parameter Estimation Algorithm (PEA)
* Precise Orbit Determination (POD), and
* Various scripts for combination and analysis of solutions

## Using Ginan with an AppImage

You can quickly download a precompiled binary of Ginan's pea from the `develop-weekly-appimage` branch of github.
This allows you to run Ginan without the need for installing external dependencies.
It contains no python scripts or example data, but is possible to run immediately on linux and windows systems as simply as:

    git clone -b develop-weekly-appimage --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/ginan.git

    ginan/Ginan-x86_64.AppImage

or on windows:

    wsl --install -d ubuntu
    ginan/Ginan-x86_64.AppImage

If the image fails to run, first ensure it is executable and all requires libraries are available

    chmod 777 ginan/Ginan-x86_64.AppImage
    apt install fuse libfuse2



## Using Ginan with Docker

You can quickly download a ready-to-run Ginan environment using docker by running:

    docker run -it -v ${host_data_folder}:/data gnssanalysis/ginan:v3.0.0 bash

This command connects the `${host_data_folder}` directory on the host (your pc), with the `/data` directory in the container, to allow file access between the two systems, and opens a command line (`bash`) for executing commands.

You will need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to use this method.

To verify you have the Ginan executables available once at the Ginan command line, run:

    pea --help


## Installation from source
### Supported Platforms

Ginan is supported and tested on the following platforms

* Linux: tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 and 22.04
* MacOS: tested on 10.15 (x86)
* Windows: via docker or WSL on Windows 10 and above

### Dependencies

If instead you wish to build Ginan from source, there are several software dependencies:

* C/C++ and Fortran compiler. We use and recommend [gcc, g++, and gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org)
* BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra libraries. We use and recommend [OpenBlas](https://www.openblas.net/) as this contains both libraries required
* CMAKE     >  3.0
* YAML      >  0.6
* Boost     >= 1.73 (tested on 1.73). On Ubuntu 22.04 which uses gcc-11, you need Boost >= 1.74.0
* MongoDB
* Mongo_C   >= 1.17.1
* Mongo_cxx >= 3.6.0
* Eigen3    >  3.4
* netCDF4
* Python    >= 3.7

If using gcc verion 11 or about, the minimum version of libraries are:
* Boost     >= 1.74.0
* Mongo_cxx =  3.7.0

Scripts to install dependencies for Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, 22.04, Fedora 38 are available on the `scripts/installation` directory. Users on other system might need to have a look at the `scripts/installation/generic.md` file, which contains the major steps.

### Python

We use Python for automated process (download), postprocessing and visualisation. To use the developed tools, we recommand to use a virtual-environement (or Anaconda equivalent). A requirements file is available in the `scripts/` directory and can be run via
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build
Prepare a directory to build in - it's better practice to keep this separated from the source code.
From the Ginan git root directory:

```bash
mkdir -p src/build

cd src/build
cmake ../
```

To build every package simply run `make` or `make -jX` , where X is a number of parallel threads you want to use for the compilation:

```bash
make -j2
```

Alternatively, to build only a specific package (`pea`, `make_otl_blq`, `interpolate_loading`), run as below:

```bash
make pea -j2
```

This should create executables in the `bin` directory of Ginan.

Check to see if you can execute the PEA from the exampleConfigs directory

```bash
cd ../../exampleConfigs

../bin/pea --help
```

and you should see something similar to:
```
PEA starting... (main ginan-v3.0.0 from Mon Feb 05 15:15:22 2024)

Options:
  -h [ --help ]                    Help
  -q [ --quiet ]                   Less output
  -v [ --verbose ]                 More output
  -V [ --very-verbose ]            Much more output
           .
           .
           .
  --dump-config-only               Dump the configuration and exit
  --walkthrough                    Run demonstration code interactively with
                                   commentary

PEA finished
```


Then download all of the example data using the scripts and filelists provided. From the Ginan git root directory:

```bash
cd inputData/data
./getData.sh
cd ../products
./getProducts.sh
```

## Documentation

Ginan documentation consists of two parts: these documents, and separate Doxygen-generated documentation that shows the actual code infrastructure.
It can be found [here](https://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/ginan/codeDocs/index.html), or generated manually as below.

### Doxygen

The Doxygen documentation for Ginan requires `doxygen` and `graphviz`. If not already installed, type as follows:

```bash
sudo apt -y install doxygen graphviz
```

On success, proceed to the build directory and call make with `docs` target:

```bash
cd ../src/build

cmake ../

make docs
```

The documentation can then be found at `Docs/codeDocs/index.html`.

Note that documentation is also generated automatically if `make` is called without arguments and `doxygen` and `graphviz` dependencies are satisfied.


## Ready!
Congratulations! You are now ready to trial the examples from the `exampleConfigs` directory. See Ginan's manual for detailed explanation of each example. Note that examples have relative paths to files in them and rely on the presence of `products` and `data` directories inside the `inputData` directory. Make sure you've run `s3_filehandler.py` from the Build step of these instructions.

The paths are relative to the `exampleConfigs` directory and hence all the examples must be run from the `exampleConfigs` directory.

NB: Examples may be configured to use mongoDB. If you have not installed it, please set `mongo: enable` to false in the pea config files.

To run the first example of the PEA:

```bash
cd ../exampleConfigs

../bin/pea --config ppp_example.yaml
```

This should create `outputs/ppp_example` directory with various `*.trace` files, which contain details about stations processing, a `Network*.trace` file, which contains the results of Kalman filtering, and other auxiliary output files as configured in the yamls.

You can remove the need for path specification to the executable by using the symlink within `exampleConfigs`, or by adding Ginan's bin directory to `~/.bashrc` file:
```
PATH="path_to_ginan_bin:$PATH"
```

NB: For PPP positioning of a single station, we have noted that limiting the number of cores to 1 can reduce processing times. This can be achieved via setting the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`:

    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 ginan/Ginan-x86_64.AppImage



## Scripts
In addition to the Ginan binaries, [scripts](https://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/ginan/page.html?c=on&p=scripts.index) are available to assist with downloading input files, and viewing and comparing generated outputs.
