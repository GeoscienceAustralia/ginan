## Pea Config Examples

Example configurations for the different `pea` use-cases are included in the git repository in the `exampleConfigs` directory.
These examples utilise a reference dataset from 2019, which demonstrate the majority of the features that are currently supported by Ginan.

For descriptions of the specifics of those examples, refer to the [Configuring Ginan](page.html?c=on&p=ginanConfiguration.md) page.
